Now that I'm done with all of the "more x genes" I had initially planned, I'm releasing this all in one mod that will allow you to not have a flooded modlist. This adds over 70 genes from the other mods into one thing. Now to answer the questions you probably have.

1) I didn't release this before now because I didn't want to have to keep updating it with every mod release. I know that's a lazy excuse, but I am a programmer. We are trained to find the quickest, and easiest, solution to every problem, even when it's inconvenient for everyone involved in the long term.

2) I didn't start with this for two reasons. First, some of my mods fundamentally change certain genes (i.e. More Psychic Genes removes the traits from the genes), which some people may not like. By keeping those separate I can give some people more customization options for their gene lists. Second, based on subscibe numbers many people don't want most of these genes, so this would flood their gene list with way too many useless options. Some people just want one or two of the mods, and considering each mod adds around 7 genes, this mod would be at least 80-90% useless to them. That's a lot of useless genes.

3) This only implements the "More X Genes", so any of my mods that adds more functionality to certain genes, like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976384929]Children Can Learn Fast[/url], will need to be subscribed to separately.

4) If you have any of the other mods enabled with this one, it will throw errors. If the error says something about having issues creating a certain gene, check your modlist for that gene mod.

5) The release of this mod doesn't mean I'm going to refuse to do any more. It just means I ran out of ideas, and could use some feedback on what you feel is still missing from the gene list.
